    MWO v3.0 is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and incorporates the modular approach
    of the NFDIcore mid-level ontology, enriching metadata through standardized classes and properties.
    The MWO addresses key aspects of MSE research data, including the NFDI-MatWerk community structure,
    covering task areas, infrastructure use cases, projects, researchers, and organizations.
    It also describes essential NFDI resources, such as software, workflows, ontologies, publications,
    datasets, metadata schemas, instruments, facilities, and educational materials. Additionally,
    MWO represents NFDI-MatWerk services, academic events, courses, and international collaborations.
    As the foundation for the MSE Knowledge Graph, MWO facilitates efficient data integration and retrieval,
    promoting collaboration and knowledge representation across MSE domains. This digital transformation
    enhances data discoverability, reusability, and accelerates scientific exchange, innovation,

    The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing sensors and their observations,

    by including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator)
    for its elementary classes and properties. With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization,
    SSN and SOSA are able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery,
    large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science,
    observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things. Both ontologies are described below,
    and examples of their usage are given.
