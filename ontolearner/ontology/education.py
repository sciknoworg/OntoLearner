    The Bibframe vocabulary consists of RDF classes and properties used for the description of
    items cataloged principally by libraries, but may also be used to describe items cataloged by museums and archives.
    Classes include the three core classes - Work, Instance, and Item - in addition to many more
    classes to support description. Properties describe characteristics of the resource being
    described as well as relationships among resources. For example: one Work
    might be a "translation of" another Work; an Instance may be an
    "instance of" a particular Bibframe Work.  Other properties describe attributes of Works and Instances.  For
    example: the Bibframe property "subject" expresses an important attribute of a Work
    (what the Work is about), and the property "extent" (e.g. number of pages) expresses an
    attribute of an Instance.
