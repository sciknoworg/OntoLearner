    The BIO vocabulary contains terms useful for finding out more about people and their backgrounds and has some cross-over into genealogical information.
    The approach taken is to describe a person's life as a series of interconnected key events, around which other information can be woven.
    This vocabulary defines the event framework and supplies a set of core event types that cover many use cases, but it is expected that it
    will be extended in other vocabularies to suit their needs. The intention of this vocabulary is to describe biographical events of people
    and this intention carries through to the definitions of the properties and classes which are person-centric rather than neutral. For example
    the Employment event puts the person being employed as the principal agent in the event rather than the employer.
