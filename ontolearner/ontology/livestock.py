    ATOL (Animal Trait Ontology for Livestock) is an ontology of characteristics defining phenotypes of livestock
    in their environment (EOL). ATOL aims to:
    - provide a reference ontology of phenotypic traits of farm animals for the international scientific and educational
    - communities, farmers, etc.;
    - deliver this reference ontology in a language which can be used by computers in order to support database management,
    semantic analysis and modeling;
    - represent traits as generic as possible for livestock vertebrates;
    - make the ATOL ontology as operational as possible and closely related to measurement techniques;
    - structure the ontology in relation to animal production.
