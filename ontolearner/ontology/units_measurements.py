    The Ontology of units of Measure (OM) models concepts and relations important to scientific research.
    It has a strong focus on units, quantities, measurements, and dimensions.
    It includes, for instance, common units such as the SI units metre and kilogram,
    but also units from other systems of units such as the mile or nautical mile. For many application areas
    it includes more specific units and quantities, such as the unit of the Hubble constant or the quantity vaselife.
    The following application areas are supported by OM: Geometry; Mechanics; Thermodynamics; Electromagnetism;
    Fluid mechanics; Chemical physics; Photometry; Radiometry and Radiobiology; Nuclear physics;
    Astronomy and Astrophysics; Cosmology; Earth science; Meteorology; Material science; Microbiology;
    Economics; Information technology and Typography.
