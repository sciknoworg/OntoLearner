    Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a dictionary of molecular entities
    focused on ‘small’ chemical compounds. The term ‘molecular entity’ refers to any constitutionally
    or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc.,
    identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity. The molecular entities in question
    are either products of nature or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms.
    ChEBI incorporates an ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities
    or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are specified.

    This class processes Chemical Entities of Biological Interest using default behavior.
