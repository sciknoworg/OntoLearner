# OntoLearner Maintenance Plan

The OntoLearner library is designed to facilitate ... . To ensure that OntoLearner remains a reliable and relevant tool for the community, we establish this Maintenance Plan to outline the ongoing maintenance efforts, the roles involved, and the strategies for addressing evolving user needs.  This library is released under [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
, a permissive open-source license that allows for community contributions, reuse, and modification. A persistent DOI ... is assigned via Zenodo to ensure permanent referencing of the latest stable release.  Release versions will be tagged on GitHub, with versioning to track major, minor, and patch updates. The release will be pushed to the [OntoLearner at PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OntoLearner/). The current version of OntoLearner is ![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/OntoLearner.svg).

## 1. Objectives & Responsibilities

The primary goals of the OntoLearner maintenance objectives are to:
- Ensure long-term availability and functionality of the library by addressing and fix bugs and issues as they arise.
- Continuously add Aligner models and extend models within the OntoLearner.
- Incorporate user feedback and adapt to evolving research trends in ontology learning.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation to support ease of use and understanding.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to maintain compatibility with the latest technology and standards.

A core team will be responsible for the ongoing maintenance of OntoAligner, including:
- **Lead Maintainers**: Oversee all maintenance activities, ensure the direction aligns with the project's vision, and handle critical issues.
  - [Hamed Babaei Giglou](https://hamedbabaei.github.io/) – Project Lead – Responsible for the overall vision, maintenance activities, and coordination of the library’s development.
  - Andrei Aionei
  -  [Dr. Jennifer D'Souza](https://sites.google.com/view/jen-web) and [Prof. Dr. Sören Auer](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/data-science-and-digital-libraries/staff/soeren-auer) – Project Supervisors and Principal Investigators (PI) – Responsible for guiding ideation, refining ideas, and defining the project's high-level direction to align the library's goals with broader academic and research objectives.
 
## 2. Current Ongoing Maintenance and Plans

A roadmap for new features and improvements, ensuring the library evolves in response to user needs and feedback is presented as follows. This list will be updated regularly as we explore the variety of works within the ontology alignment field to ensure the diverse methods within the library.
