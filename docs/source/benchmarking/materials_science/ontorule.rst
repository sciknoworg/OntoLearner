Ontology for the Steel Domain (ONTORULE)
========================================

Overview
-----------------
This deliverable consists of the ontology developed in ONTORULE for the steel industry use case.
It is presented as an attachment to this document as an html document which was generated by SpecGen
from the OWL file. The original OWL file is also included. This document describes the different concepts
and attributes included in the ontology. For a better understanding of the decisions taken at the time
of representing the knowledge in the ontology, the reader is encouraged to also read the document D5.4.
