LLMs4OL: Large Language Models for Ontology Learning
====================================================
The LLMs4OL (Large Language Models for Ontology Learning) paradigm represents
a transformative approach to automated ontology construction and enrichment.
OntoLearner implements state-of-the-art LLM-based methodologies that leverage
the vast knowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to perform
sophisticated ontological reasoning and knowledge extraction.

Introduction to LLMs4OL
-----------------------
Traditional ontology learning approaches relied heavily on statistical methods,
rule-based systems, and classical machine learning techniques. The emergence
of large language models has revolutionized this field by providing models that:

- **Encode vast world knowledge** from diverse textual sources during pre-training
- **Understand semantic relationships** between concepts across multiple domains
- **Perform complex reasoning** about hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships
- **Generate structured outputs** through carefully designed prompting strategies

OntoLearner's LLMs4OL implementation supports three distinct paradigms
for applying LLMs to ontology learning tasks.

LLMs4OL Paradigms
-----------------

Paradigm 1: Pure LLM-Based Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Approach**: Direct application of LLMs without external knowledge retrieval.

**Methodology**: This paradigm relies entirely on the model's internalized knowledge from pre-training.
The LLM receives task-specific prompts that encode ontological requirements and generates structured
responses based on its learned representations.

**Advantages**:
- No dependency on external knowledge bases
- Fast inference without retrieval overhead
- Leverages comprehensive world knowledge from pre-training
- Effective for well-known domains covered in training data

**Limitations**:
- May hallucinate relationships not present in training data
- Limited by the model's training cutoff date
- Potential inconsistency across related predictions

**Implementation**:

.. code-block:: python

    from ontolearner import LearnerPipeline, AutoLearnerLLM, Wine, train_test_split

    # Load ontology data
    ontology = Wine()
    ontology.load()
    train_data, test_data = train_test_split(ontology.extract(), test_size=0.2)

    # Create pure LLM pipeline
    pipeline = LearnerPipeline(
        task="taxonomy-discovery",
        llm=AutoLearnerLLM(token="your_huggingface_token"),
        llm_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
    )

    # Evaluate without retrieval
    results, metrics = pipeline.fit_predict_evaluate(
        train_data=train_data,
        test_data=test_data,
        test_limit=10
    )

    print(f"Pure LLM Accuracy: {metrics['avg_accuracy']:.3f}")

Paradigm 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Approach**: Combines semantic retrieval with LLM generation for grounded ontological reasoning.

**Methodology**: RAG systems first retrieve relevant ontological examples from the training data
using semantic similarity, then provide these examples as context to guide the LLM's generation.
This approach grounds the model's responses in actual ontological structures.

**Advantages**:
- Grounded in domain-specific training examples
- Reduces hallucination through contextual evidence
- Adapts to specialized domains not well-covered in pre-training
- Maintains consistency with existing ontological patterns

**Limitations**:
- Requires high-quality training data for retrieval
- Additional computational overhead from retrieval step
- Performance depends on retrieval quality

**Implementation**:

.. code-block:: python

    from ontolearner import LearnerPipeline, Wine, train_test_split

    # Load ontology data
    ontology = Wine()
    ontology.load()
    train_data, test_data = train_test_split(ontology.extract(), test_size=0.2)

    # Create RAG pipeline
    pipeline = LearnerPipeline(
        task="term-typing",
        retriever_id="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        llm_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",
        hf_token="your_huggingface_token"
    )

    # Evaluate with retrieval augmentation
    results, metrics = pipeline.fit_predict_evaluate(
        train_data=train_data,
        test_data=test_data,
        top_k=3,  # Retrieve top-3 similar examples
        test_limit=10
    )

    print(f"RAG F1-Score: {metrics['avg_f1_score']:.3f}")
    print(f"RAG Exact Match: {metrics['avg_exact_match']:.3f}")

Paradigm 3: Hybrid Ensemble Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Approach**: Combines multiple LLM-based approaches for robust ontological predictions.

**Methodology**: This paradigm leverages the strengths of different LLM architectures,
prompting strategies, and retrieval methods. Ensemble techniques aggregate predictions
from multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce individual model biases.

**Advantages**:
- Improved robustness through model diversity
- Reduced impact of individual model limitations
- Better handling of edge cases and ambiguous relationships
- Higher overall accuracy through consensus

**Limitations**:
- Increased computational requirements
- More complex implementation and maintenance
- Potential for conflicting predictions requiring resolution strategies

**Implementation**:

.. code-block:: python

    from ontolearner import LearnerPipeline, AutoLearnerLLM, BERTRetrieverLearner
    from ontolearner.learner import AutoRAGLearner, StandardizedPrompting
    from ontolearner.ontology import Wine
    from ontolearner.utils.train_test_split import train_test_split

    # Load data
    ontology = Wine()
    ontology.load()
    train_data, test_data = train_test_split(ontology.extract(), test_size=0.2)

    # Create multiple learners
    llm_learner = AutoLearnerLLM(token="your_token")
    llm_learner.load("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")

    retriever = BERTRetrieverLearner()
    retriever.load("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    prompting = StandardizedPrompting(task="term-typing")
    rag_learner = AutoRAGLearner(retriever, llm_learner, prompting)

    # Ensemble evaluation (simplified example)
    learners = [llm_learner, rag_learner]
    ensemble_results = []

    for learner in learners:
        pipeline = LearnerPipeline(task="term-typing", learner=learner)
        results, metrics = pipeline.fit_predict_evaluate(
            train_data=train_data,
            test_data=test_data,
            test_limit=5
        )
        ensemble_results.append(metrics)

    # Aggregate ensemble performance
    avg_f1 = sum(r['avg_f1_score'] for r in ensemble_results) / len(ensemble_results)
    print(f"Ensemble Average F1-Score: {avg_f1:.3f}")

Prompting Strategies for Ontology Learning
------------------------------------------
Effective prompting is crucial for LLMs4OL success. OntoLearner implements
standardized prompting strategies optimized for each ontology learning task:

**Term Typing Prompts**:

.. code-block:: text

    Given a list of types as candidates to be assigned to the term,
    identify the most probable types.
    Return the types only in the form of a list.
    Do not provide any explanation outside the list.

    Term: {term}
    Candidates Types: {context}
    Response:

**Taxonomy Discovery Prompts**:

.. code-block:: text

    Is {parent} a parent of {child}?
    Answer yes/no. Do not explain.

**Non-Taxonomic Relation Discovery Prompts**:

.. code-block:: text

    What is the relation between {head} and {tail}?
    Return only the relation type.

These prompts are designed to:
- **Minimize ambiguity** through clear, specific instructions
- **Enforce structured outputs** that can be parsed programmatically
- **Reduce hallucination** by constraining response formats
- **Optimize for consistency** across similar ontological contexts

Evaluation Framework
-------------------
OntoLearner provides comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored for LLMs4OL:

**Term Typing Metrics**:
- **Precision**: Fraction of predicted types that are correct
- **Recall**: Fraction of actual types that were predicted
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Exact Match**: Whether predicted types exactly match ground truth

**Taxonomy Discovery Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: Fraction of correctly predicted hierarchical relationships
- **F1-Score**: Balanced measure for binary classification

**Non-Taxonomic Relation Discovery Metrics**:
- **Exact Match**: Whether predicted relation exactly matches ground truth
- **Similarity Score**: String similarity between predicted and actual relations
