Ontology Repositories
-----------------------

OntoLearner provides seamless integration with HuggingFace, allowing you to easily download ontologies and use. OntoLearner follows a systematic methodology for processing and distributing ontologies through Hugging Face. Each ontology undergoes a comprehensive processing pipeline that includes: (1) loading and parsing the original ontology file, (2) extracting structured learning datasets including term typings, taxonomic relations, and non-taxonomic relations, (3) computing detailed metrics about the ontology's topology and content, (4) generating comprehensive documentation, and (5) organizing the processed data by domain and uploading to dedicated Hugging Face repositories. This approach ensures that researchers have access to both the original ontologies and ready-to-use datasets optimized for machine learning applications, while maintaining full traceability and documentation of the processing methodology.


OntoLearner maintains a set of default repositories for each domain under the `SciKnowOrg <https://huggingface.co/collections/SciKnowOrg/>`_ organization. These repositories follow the naming pattern ``SciKnowOrg/ontolearner-{domain}`` and contain pre-processed ontology data.

.. hint::
   Each ontology repository on Hugging Face includes comprehensive documentation:

   * **README.md**: Contains information about the domain and available ontologies
   * **Usage Examples**: Code snippets showing how to use the ontologies

   See the `SciKnowOrg/ontolearner-agriculture <https://huggingface.co/datasets/SciKnowOrg/ontolearner-agriculture>`_ repository as an example.

Metrics Space
---------------

OntoLearner offers an interactive Metrics Space on HuggingFace that visualizes ontology metrics across many benchmarked domains. Available at the `SciKnowOrg/OntoLearner‚ÄëBenchmark‚ÄëMetrics <https://huggingface.co/spaces/SciKnowOrg/OntoLearner-Benchmark-Metrics>`_ space, it displays structured metrics for each ontology‚Äîsuch as total nodes, edges, classes, hierarchy depth, breadth, and dataset benchmarks like term types and relations  Researchers can explore ontology complexity and coverage visually, compare across domains, and validate suitability before using ontologies in learning tasks.


.. note::
       You can download the full ontology metrics Excel file from `this link <https://huggingface.co/spaces/SciKnowOrg/OntoLearner-Benchmark-Metrics/resolve/main/metrics.xlsx>`_.

.. hint::

   This file is automatically updated whenever a new ontology is modularized, ensuring you always have the latest benchmark metrics.
