**OntoLearner**  is a modular and extensible architecture designed to support ontology learning and reuse. The conceptual and functional architecture of OntoLearner is shown as following. The framework comprises three core components‚Äî**Ontologizers**, **Learning Tasks**, and **Learner Models**‚Äîstructured to enable reusable and customizable ontology engineering workflows.

## üß™ Installation

OntoLearner is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OntoLearner/) and you can install using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ontolearner
```

Next, verify the installation:
```python
import ontolearner

print(ontolearner.__version__)
```

| **[üìö OntoLearner Documentation](https://ontolearner.readthedocs.io/)** | Dive into OntoLearner's extensive documentation to explore its modular architecture, including Ontologizers, Learning Tasks, and Learner Models. The documentation provides detailed guides, references, and tutorials to help you get started and make the most of OntoLearner's capabilities.  |
|**[ü§ó Datasets on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/SciKnowOrg/ontolearner-benchmarking-6823bcd051300c210b7ef68a)**| You can access the curated colloctions of machine-readable ontologies across diverse domains such as agriculture, medicine, social sciences, and more. OntoLearner Benchmarking datasets are optimized for integration into generative AI pipelines, supporting versioning, streaming, and metadata inspection.|


## üöÄ Quick Tour
Get started with OntoLearner in just a few lines of code. This guide demonstrates how to initialize ontologies, load datasets, and train an LLM-assisted learner for ontology engineering tasks.

**Basic Usage**:
```python
from ontolearner.ontology import Wine

# 1. Initialize an ontologizer from OntoLearner
ontology = Wine()

# 2. Load the ontology automatically from Hugging Face
ontology.load()

# 3. Extract the learning task dataset
data = ontology.extract()
```

**LLM-Based Learning Pipeline**:
```python
from ontolearner import ontology, utils, learner

# 1. Load the ontology and extract training data
onto = ontology.Wine()
data = onto.extract()

# 2. Split into train and test sets
train_data, test_data = utils.train_test_split(
    data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# 3. Initialize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) learner
retriever = learner.BERTRetrieverLearner()
llm = learner.AutoLearnerLLM()
prompt = learner.StandardizedPrompting(task="term-typing")

rag_learner = learner.AutoRAGLearner(
    learner_retriever=retriever,
    learner_llm=llm,
    prompting=prompt
)

# 4. Load pretrained components
rag_learner.load(
    retriever_id="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    llm_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
)

# 5. Fit the model to training data
rag_learner.fit(train_data=train_data, task="term-typing")

# 6. Predict on test data
predicted = rag_learner.predict(test_data, task="term-typing")
```
