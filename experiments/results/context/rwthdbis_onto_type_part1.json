    "term_info": "Zymosterol biosynthetic process, a biological process within the Gene Ontology, encompasses the ordered series of biochemical reactions resulting in the formation of zymosterol. This is a specific type of sterol biosynthetic process focused on a particular sterol intermediate. It begins with defined precursor molecules and involves a sequence of enzymatic modifications, altering the chemical structure of the substrate at each step. The process operates at the cellular and molecular level, within cellular compartments where sterol biosynthesis enzymes are localized. Its function is to produce zymosterol, a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol and other sterols. The progress of this process can be measured through quantifying the relative concentrations of zymosterol and its precursors or products"

    "term": "zymogen granule",
    "term_info": "Zymogen granule is a membrane-bound intracellular secretory granule that functions within certain secretory cells to store inactive protease precursors prior to regulated secretion. It belongs to the category of dense-core secretory granules that arise through the cell’s secretory pathway and reside in the cytoplasm before being released. Defining features include: a surrounding lipid bilayer membrane that encloses a lumen containing inactive enzyme precursors; a morphological appearance characterized by an electron-dense core when observed with electron microscopy; origin through packaging in the secretory pathway and maturation as part of regulated secretion; and a readiness for rapid fusion with the plasma membrane in response to appropriate stimuli, enabling exocytosis of its cargo. The granule environment is typically more acidic than the cytosol, and its contents are maintained in an inactive state until release. Scope and scale describe the granule as present in specialized secretory cells, notably exocrine pancreas–related lineages and certain neuroendocrine cells. Its size is on the order of a few hundred nanometers up to nearly a micron in diameter, and its abundance within a cell can vary with physiological state and secretory demand. The granule’s membrane and lumen define a discrete, contained volume that supports concentrated cargo storage and controlled release. Roles and functions center on protecting the cell from autodigestion by sequestering digestive enzyme precursors and enabling their controlled, stimulus-dependent deployment. By concentrating cargo and enabling rapid externalization, the granule supports timely digestive or signaling processes in response to appropriate cues, while maintaining cellular integrity during storage. Measurable attributes include morphological indicators such as the presence of a surrounding membrane and an electron-dense core observable by microscopy; luminal characteristics such as pH relative to the cytosol and the density of the contained cargo; dynamic properties such as rate and extent of exocytosis in response to stimuli; and quantitative attributes such as approximate granule diameter, number per cell, and changes in granule number or release rate under varying secretory conditions"
