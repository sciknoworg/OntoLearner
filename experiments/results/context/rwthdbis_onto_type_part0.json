    "term_info": "Zymosterol metabolic process, a process within the Gene Ontology (GO) domain, encompasses the series of biochemical reactions and transformations involved in the synthesis, modification, and degradation of zymosterol. This process is a specific type of sterol metabolism, focusing on the molecule zymosterol. It is characterized by enzymatic steps that alter the chemical structure of zymosterol, including the addition or removal of functional groups, changes in the carbon skeleton, and the formation of other sterol intermediates. The scope of this process is at the molecular level, involving individual molecules and their interactions. The primary function is to regulate the levels of zymosterol and its derivatives within a biological system. Measurable attributes include the rates of enzymatic reactions, the concentrations of zymosterol and its metabolites, and the activity levels of the enzymes involved"

    "term": "zymogen granule exocytosis",
    "term_info": "Zymogen granule exocytosis is a biological process that belongs to the class of secretory events in which a membrane‑enclosed storage organelle releases its internal cargo to the external milieu of the cell. The defining characteristic of this process is the directed movement of a zymogen granule toward the cell periphery, followed by the merging of the granule membrane with the surrounding cellular envelope, resulting in the opening of a passage that allows the lumenal contents to exit the cell. The scope of the process is confined to the individual cellular compartment that contains these granules, and it can be observed and quantified at the single‑cell level as discrete release events. Functionally, the process serves to transport inactive precursor proteins that are packaged within the granules to the extracellular space where they can become available for activation or subsequent biochemical reactions. This delivery mechanism contributes to the regulation of extracellular enzymatic activity and participates in maintaining homeostatic balance of secreted proteolytic potential. Measurable attributes associated with zymogen granule exocytosis include the frequency of release events per unit time, the size and number of granules undergoing fusion, the kinetic parameters of membrane merging (such as latency and duration of the fusion pore), the concentration of cargo released per event, and the dependence of the process on intracellular signaling cues such as calcium flux. These quantitative features provide a basis for assessing the efficiency and regulation of the exocytotic activity"
